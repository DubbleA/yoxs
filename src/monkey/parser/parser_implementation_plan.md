1. Setup and Initialization:
Create the necessary C++ files (parser.cpp and parser.hpp) and include the necessary headers (lexer.hpp, token.hpp, ast.hpp).
Define a Parser class which will hold the parsing logic, lexer instance, and current and next tokens.
Implement a constructor to initialize the parser with a lexer instance, and setup initial tokens.
2. Token Precedence:
Define an enumeration and a map for token precedence to manage the order of operations during parsing.
3. Prefix and Infix Parse Functions:
Create method pointer typedefs for prefix and infix parse functions.
Define maps to hold these functions keyed by token type.
Register the parsing functions for different token types.
4. Parsing Statements and Expressions:
Implement methods to parse different kinds of statements (let, return, expression statement) and expressions (identifiers, literals, prefix and infix expressions, etc.).
Handle parsing precedence and associativity by checking token precedence and calling the appropriate parsing functions.
5. Error Handling:
Implement error handling to capture syntax errors and provide meaningful error messages.
Collect errors in a vector for reporting back to the user.
6. Parsing Utility Functions:
Implement utility functions for common parsing tasks, like checking the type of the current or next token, and advancing the lexer.
7. Constructing the AST:
Create nodes in the AST as parsing progresses.
Ensure each AST node captures the necessary information from the source code, like token literals and values.
8. Testing and Validation:
Write comprehensive tests to validate the parser against various Monkey programs.
Ensure the parser generates correct ASTs and captures errors appropriately.
9. Optimization and Refinement:
Review the parser code for any optimizations that can be made.
Ensure the code is well-organized, well-documented, and follows C++ best practices.
10. Integration:
Integrate the parser with the lexer and other components of the Monkey interpreter.
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the entire pipeline from source code to AST works as expected.
